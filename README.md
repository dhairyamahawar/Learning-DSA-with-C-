# DSA Practice by [Dhairya Mahawar]

This repository contains my personal practice solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  
I'm following a structured roadmap covering topics like Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and more.

## 📅 Goal
Solve and commit at least [3-5] DSA problems per week consistently.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- [x] Arrays
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Linked Lists
- [ ] Stacks & Queues
- [ ] Trees & Graphs
- [ ] Dynamic Programming
- [ ] Sorting & Searching

## 🗂 Folder Structure
Each folder represents a DSA topic.  
Each file contains a single C++ solution with proper comments for better understanding.

## ✍️ Notes
All problems are practiced from platforms like:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [CodeStudio](https://www.naukri.com/code360/)
